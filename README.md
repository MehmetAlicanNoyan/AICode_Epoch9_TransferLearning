# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 9: Transfer Learning

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 9.

# Challenge description

This week you will learn how to use transfer learning to build a neural network. You will sample 300 images from MNIST for training (The MNIST training set contains 60,000 images) in order see how a simple model can achieve high accuracy using a small dataset.

* Download a pre-trained CNN without the top layer
* Use it to extract features from your input data
* Train a neural network with these new features and labels
